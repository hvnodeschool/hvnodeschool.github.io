<p><strong>Here's the list of things you'll need to bring</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>A laptop with wifi. Windows, Mac, or Linux will do. </li>
<li>An appetite. Oh yes, you will accidentally <strong>all</strong> the pizza. </li>
<li>You agree to follow the code of conduct found <a href="http://confcodeofconduct.com">here</a>, i.e., <em>don't be a jerk</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Prior to the event, if you could install Node.js on your machine, that would be great. If not, no worries, we'll help you install it.</p>
